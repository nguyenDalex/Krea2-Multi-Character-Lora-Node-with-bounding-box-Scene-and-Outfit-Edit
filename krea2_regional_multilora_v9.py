"""
Krea2RegionalMultiLoRAV9 (By Fedor)

Architecture (stacked, not mutually exclusive):

  LIKENESS — always the original V2 engine
    * regional character LoRA (activation-delta, masked to each box)
    * photo latent-mold (post-CFG pull toward each region's ref photo)
    Source of truth for "does this look like the person?"

  EDIT — opt-in krea2edit layer (edit anything)
    * Identity Edit LoRA + grounded encode + official two-ref / sequential
    * Triggered by: use_krea2edit=True  OR  any IMAGE on extra_ref_1..4
    * Character LoRAs + molds stay armed on the final sample

Reference photos — BOTH paths kept:

  1) In-node: per-region "Load Ref" upload (regions_json.ref_image)
     → character identity for V2 mold (+ edit subject frames when editing)
     → optional auto-portrait is a visual identity reference / diagnostic;
       portrait-off generation uses bbox-routed region text + direct LoRA deltas

  2) Standalone LoadImage / Load Photo nodes → extra_ref_1..4
     → edit plates, typed by refs_json: scene (becomes the canvas) or
       person / object / style (each becomes its own krea2edit reference frame).
       The role also decides the referring text the node writes, so clauses name
       the right frame ordinal — something a hand-typed prompt cannot do, since
       the frame order depends on how many plates are wired.

No Pose Studio / SAM required.

    [scene | aux plates... | subject], so every extra_ref plate pushes the subject
    further back — saying "second" then points the model at an outfit/prop plate
    instead of the face.

    The scene clause is also deliberately weaker than V7's "keep the scene
    unchanged": that phrasing suppresses any box prompt asking for a new pose or
    action, which is most of what this node is used for.

    prior_subjects is how many characters are ALREADY composed into the scene

    characters exactly one is in there, and asking for people plural where there
